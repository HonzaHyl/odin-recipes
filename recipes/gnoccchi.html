    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato, flour, and egg.</p>
    <p>Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. 
        Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or saut√©ed with butter and herbs.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. 
            Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. 
            Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
